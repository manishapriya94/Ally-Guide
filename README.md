Each of the above is linked to a section/table in this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dZgMP22Hgk6l6hmbzkX4vAjJBUqk_ytio7KJzU2viZk/edit?usp=sharing), please add resources to what you feel called to there. 

As we set up infrastructure, we could really use your help to help populate these fields with current updates. This is a people movement, please let us know what could be made better and where we should expand
